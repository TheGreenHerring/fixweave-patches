@CobraFix
'The replacement program loaded below
'fixes a program error where the Cobra's
'code errors out when making the correct
'choice (give away all your gems) from
'trying to use "#Go" without a direction
'to run a "Go" label, unless you select
'the choice while carrying no gems at all.
'
'This also fixes a typo in an /i command
'causing the first two lines of the snake
'eating the gems to display in one window
'connected by the idle command chain
'itself, and the gem-eating messages
'appearing too fast because of a missing
'#cycle command; and inserts spaces in
'before and after "Rook sets down all his
'gems" so the player can actually read
'the message before the action occurs.
