Cobra: Who are you?
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Rook: Nice talking cobra.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Cobra: Ssssshut up.  Who are you?
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Rook: Fred!.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Cobra: Ah!  Tasty little Fred!.  This may
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
prove to be an appetizing meal.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Rook: Especially with a light wine.  Not.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Why not someone else?  Or a favor...
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Cobra: What could you possssibly offer?  
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
I ssssee no meat upon you...
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Rook: How about a pretty gem?
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Cobra: Ah!  A pretty jewel!  I want all
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
the gemssss you can give me.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Rook: But...
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Cobra: Do it or ssssuffer my wrath.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
Rook decides to:

!x1; Give all of his gems.
!x2; Give some of his gems.
!x3; Give none of his gems.
#End
:X1
 
Rook sets all of his gems by the cobra.
 
#Cycle 1
/i
:Do
#Take Gems 1 #Yo 
#Do

:Yo
#Cycle 3
The cobra eats each gem.
/i/i/i/i/i/i
Cobra: Excccellent.  Now I will leave.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
The cobra slithers into an unseen hole
and is gone.
#die

:X2
Cobra: I sssense that you hold gemss back.
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
:X3
Without warning, the cobra lunges it fangs
into Rook's lungs.  The poison acts
immediately, ands Rook falls to the ground
only to be squeezed to death by the snake
and then devoured.
