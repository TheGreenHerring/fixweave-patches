# FixWeave patch for "Tower of ZZT" by Wong Chung Bang
- Game location: https://museumofzzt.com/file/t/towerzzt/
- Requires: FixWeave v1.0e or later

This is a quick patch to fix a game-stopping error in _Tower of ZZT_ by Wong Chung Bang which prevents accessing the final boards of the game: "The Depths" (board 14) is supposed to be reached from the "Basement" (board 8), but neither board was connected to each other in any direction. This patch adds a one-way connection to The Depths, since you're explicitly not intended to be able to backtrack once you get there.
