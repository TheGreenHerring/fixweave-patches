# FixWeave patch for "Tower of ZZT" by DavidN
- Game location: https://museumofzzt.com/file/t/towerzzt/
- Requires: FixWeave v1.0e or later

This is a patch to fix a game-stopping error in _Tower of ZZT_ by DavidN which prevents accessing the final boards of the game: "The Depths" (board 14) is supposed to be reached from the "Basement" (board 8), but neither board was connected to each other in any direction. This patch adds a one-way connection to The Depths, since you're explicitly not intended to be able to backtrack once you get there.

This patch also changes the author name on the title screen to match their preferred name, under which the third game in the _ZZT: The Next Chapter_ series was released.
