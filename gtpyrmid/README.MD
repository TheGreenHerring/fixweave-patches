# FixWeave patch for _Great Pyramid of ZZT_ by DavidN
- v1.0
- Game location: https://museumofzzt.com/file/g/gtpyrmid/
- Requires: FixWeave v1.0e or later

This patch changes the author credit in-game to the author's current name, under which _Castle of ZZT_, the third game in the _ZZT: The Next Chapter_ series, was released. On the STK version, it also recolors the disappearing wall on the first board to match its surroundings, like it does in the regular version.
