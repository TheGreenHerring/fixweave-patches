$ZZT: The Next Chapter
$World IX

$Great Pyramid of ZZT
$--------------------

After escaping from the Tower of ZZT, you
escaped back into the Town and took refuge
in a giant pyramid on the edge of the
Town, believed to have been built by an
ancient forgotten race. After entering the
Pyramid, you triggered a stone door that
closed, blocking your way out. Fumbling
in the dark, you eventually arrived at a
brightly-lit room with a huge statue in
the centre.

With no idea how you got to here, you
will have to find an alternative escape
route out of the other side of the Great
Pyramid of ZZT...
