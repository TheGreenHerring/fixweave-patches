@FixSpiderGuns
'Fixes the Leader Spider's guns so that
'they will not destroy the barriers
'intended to protect them from each
'other, fixes the water placement
'preventing two guns from reaching the
'bottom end, makes more space to shoot
'the easternmost gun, replaces the
'pointless keys and doors with a "door"
'that opens when the gray guns are
'destroyed, prevents the player from
'shooting the breakables past one of
'the final guns, and adds a proper "death"
'effect for the spider when the guns are
'destroyed.
'
'This uses Weave functionality, but it
'should be possible to replicate this in
'ZZT 3.2 with a complicated array of
'well-placed objects.
