TOMATO MAN!
/i/i/i/i
In case you're wondering who Tomato Man
is, I'll explain.
/i
Tomato Man was born on the planet 
Tomatoe. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Tomaty. 
/i
One day, Tomato Man was walking home, when
he was suddenly transported to another 
world--Earth.
/i
Amazingly, he had all of his clothing,
ammo, and other items.
/i
However, a creation from Hell escaped from
Hell and was wreaking havoc on Earth at 
the same time.
/i
They both managed to stumble upon each
other, and Viper Man (the creation) stole
his bags!
/i
How rude, huh?
/i/i/i
Your quest is to find Tomato Man's luggage
and kill Viper Man!
