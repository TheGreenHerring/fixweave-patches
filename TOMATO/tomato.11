'Fix a major design error that prevents
'completion of the game by opening a path
'from the previous board into this one.
'Yes, even if you'd be blocked from
'entering this board otherwise, this
'code still runs and fixes it for you so
'that you enter this board anyway!

'Also color the sides of the new path for
'consistency with the path up top.

'Fix the "Thing" that controls the life
'bar to use "?s" instead of "/s" so it
'will proceed with its program even if
'it's blocked trying to move south; name
'its "reached the end" label differently
'from the normal one; and loop its attempt
'to relay to the boss until he receives
'the signal, all to prevent a softlock by
'shooting the boss over and over.

'Fix the End Boss to lock himself when he
'dies, and also fix a one-character typo
'preventing one frame of his death
'animation from being shown.
