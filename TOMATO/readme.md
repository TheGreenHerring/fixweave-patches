# FixWeave patch for "Tomato Man" by Greg Gilbert
- Game location: https://museumofzzt.com/file/t/tomato/
- Requires: FixWeave v1.0c or later

This fixes a game-stopping error that prevents you from reaching the final fight by having a passage created with code to get there. Without the patch, you cannot reach the final fight because its board design blocks any entry from the board that is linked to it.
