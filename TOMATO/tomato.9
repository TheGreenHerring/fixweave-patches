'Fix the regular doors so you cannot open
'them over and over. Also, make the second
'regular door give 50 ammo due to the
'likelihood of running out of ammo when
'you get there; and have it put fakes on
'initial touch to push aside any ruffians
'blocking it.

'Make it so that the bear door will not

'through it, rather than wait 21 #cycle 2
'idles and then close to softlock the
'game for no reason. Also, fix the "ERR:
'Bad command LOOPE" bug; this is as easy
'as adding an extra line break at the
'start (yes, really), but it also needs
'a name for the closer program to use.
'(The closer program is loaded into an
'object whose original code is no longer
'needed due to the next bugfix after this
'one.)
