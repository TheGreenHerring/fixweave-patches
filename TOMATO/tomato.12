'Fix the loop for closing off the entrance

'you have to do this if you're using a
'label at the start without a name).

'Then, for ZZT 3.2 pre-patched world
'purposes, briefly move the object away to
'add a solid to its location, then place
'it back on top of the solid so a hole is
'not left behind when it moves. This is
'because the unpatched code's attempt to
'"#put w blue solid" to fix that will not
'work in ZZT 3.2 due to an infamous bug
'that prevents putting anything on the
'bottom row of the board.
